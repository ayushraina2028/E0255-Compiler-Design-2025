\subsection*{Iteration Space and Iteration Vector}
Consider the code block below:
\begin{lstlisting}
for(i = 0;i < N; ++i) {
    for(j = 0;j < N; ++j) {
        /* Do Some Work */
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
$I_s = \{(i,j) : 0 \leq i,j < N\}$ and each point $(i,j)$ in this space is called an iteration vector. $i,j$ are called \textbf{iteration variables} or \textbf{loop induction values}. Iteration vectors tuples contains loop induction values starting from outermost loop to innermost loop.

Consider the following code block:
\begin{lstlisting}
for(i = 0;i < N; ++i) {
    for(j = 0;j < i; ++j) {
        for(k = 0;k < j; ++k) {
            /* Do Some Work */
        }
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

In this case $I_s = \{(i,j,k) : 0 \leq i < N, 0 \leq j < i, 0 \leq k < j\}$, and each point $(i,j,k)$ in this space is called an iteration vector. $i,j,k \in \mathcal{Z}$ are called \textbf{iteration variables} or \textbf{loop induction values}.

\subsection*{Lexicographical Order}
$(i,j) < (i',j')$ if $i < i'$ or $i = i'$ and $j < j'$. In General for $n$ dimensional space, $(i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_n) < (i_1',i_2',\ldots,i_n')$ if $\exists \; k \in \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ such that $i_k < i_k'$ and $i_i = i_i'$ for $i < k$.

\subsection*{Lexicographical Ordering of Iteration Vectors}
Consider the following code block:
\begin{lstlisting}
for(i = 0;i < N; ++i) {
    for(j = 0;j < N; ++j) {
        /* Do Some Work */
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

The lexicographical ordering of iteration vectors is as follows:
$(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), \ldots, (0,N-1), (1,0), (1,1), \ldots, (1,N-1), \ldots, (N-1,0), (N-1,1), \ldots, (N-1,N-1)$. In this course we will plot $i$ on y-axis and $j$ on x-axis.

\subsection*{Lexicographically $>$ 0}
Iteration vectors $(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n)$ are said to be lexicographically $>$ 0 if first non zero loop induction value is positive. For example, $(0,0,0)$ is lexicographical $ \geq $ 0, $(0,0,1)$ is lexicographical $ > 0$. 

Consider the following code block:
\begin{lstlisting}
for(i = 0;i < N; ++i) { /* Loop Header */
    for(j = 0;j < i; ++j) { /* Loop Header */
        A[i][j] = A[i-1][j] + A[i][j-1]; /* Loop Body */
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
Above code blocks has $N^2$ iteration vectors. Hence $N^2 ! $ possible ways to arrange these vectors. How to find the valid orderings of these vectors?. A valid ordering means an ordering which does not change the semantics of the program.

\subsection*{Dependence Analysis}
RAW - Read After Write \\
WAW - Write After Write \\
WAR - Write After Read \\

These are some of the dependencies that can occur in a program. Using this information we can take out the invalid orderings of the iteration vectors. In above program there are 2 reads $R_1, R_2$, one write $W_1$. Two instructions are dependent in one of them is write and other is read, same in the case of load and store. In this we have Write$(W_1)$ after Read $R_1,R_2$. In this program to do $W_1$ at $(i,j)$ using $R_1$ at $(i',j')$, the following conditions must be satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $i = i'-1$
    \item $j = j'$
\end{itemize}

Similarly we have dependence between $W_1$ and $R_2$. To do $W_1$ at $(i,j)$ using $R_2$ at $(i',j')$, the following conditions must be satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $i = i'$
    \item $j = j'-1$
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Distance Vectors}
Consider the following code block:
\begin{lstlisting}
for(i = 0;i < N; ++i) {
    for(j = 0;j < i; ++j) {
        A[j][i] = B[j][i]; /* Copying Array Elements */
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
In this case we can do loop interchange to get the following code block:
\begin{lstlisting}
for(j = 0;j < N; ++j) {
    for(i = 0;i < j; ++j) {
        A[j][i] = B[j][i]; /* Copying Array Elements */
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

But this will change the execution order, but will this loop interchange will lead to same results ? If we do dependence analysis here we will find that there is no dependence between the two loops because they both are working on different arrays. Hence any ordering of iterations will lead to same results. \\
Now change B to A in above code to get the following code block:
\begin{lstlisting}
for(i = 0;i < N; ++i) {
    for(j = 0;j < i; ++j) {
        A[j][i] = A[i][j]; /* Copying Array Elements */
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
We will test for Read After Write dependence between the two loops. Suppose Read $R_1$ is at $(i,j)$ and Write $W_1$ is at $(i',j')$. To do $R_1$ at $(i,j)$ using $W_1$ at $(i',j')$, the one of the following two conditions must be satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $i' \geq i+1,j' = j, i' = j, j' = i$
    \item $i' = i, j' \geq j+1, i' = j, j' = i$
\end{itemize}

where $0 \leq i,j,i',j' \leq N$. Similarly we can do the same for Write After Read dependence analysis. Suppose Write $W_1$ is at $(j,i)$ and Read $R_1$ is at $(i',j')$. To do $W_1$ at $(j,i)$ using $R_1$ at $(i',j')$, the one of the following two conditions must be satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $i' \geq i+1,j' = j, i' = j, j' = i$
    \item $i' = i, j' \geq j+1, i' = j, j' = i$
\end{itemize}

where $0 \leq i,j,i',j' \leq N$. \\ 

Consider the $n$ dimensional space $I_s = \{(i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_n) : 0 \leq i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_n < N\}$. Let $\vec{S}, \vec{T}$ be given. The distance vector between $\vec{s}$ and $\vec{t}$ is defined as $\vec{d} = \vec{t} - \vec{s}$. Then $\forall \; (\vec{s}, \vec{t})$ st there is a dependence between $\vec{s}$ to $\vec{t}$, then $T(\vec{t}) - T(\vec{s}) > 0$, where T is a linear transformation. \\

Further if T is a linear transformation then $T(\vec{t}) - T(\vec{s}) = T(\vec{t} - \vec{s}) = T(\vec{d}) > 0$. Hence $\vec{d}$ is lexicographically $> 0$ if $(\vec{s},\vec{t})$ is a constant distanc vector.

\subsection*{Fully Permutable Loops}
If all the Permutations of distance vectors are constant i.e all the components are positive then the loops are said to be fully permutable. All the Loop Orderings will lead to same results.

\subsection*{Optimizations : Locality}
Locality means being close together, we want to focus on data locality which means how close are we to data that we are using. We will talk about Latency and Bandwidth. Latency: Time taken to access a single data element. Bandwidth: Number of data elements that can be accessed in a given time, say per cycle. \\

Further we have two types of locality: \\
1. \textbf{Locality in Space (Spatial Locality)} : If we are accessing a data element at some particular address, we are likely to access the different address close to it. \\ \\
2. \textbf{Locality in Time (Temporal Locality)}: If we are accessing a data element at some particular address, we are likely to access the same address in near future. \\

Compiler transformations can enhance locality. Loop Interchange can enhance the Spatial Locality. For example
\begin{lstlisting}
    for(int i = 0;i < 100; i++) {
        for(int j = 0;j < 100; j++) {
            /* Do Some work using f(j,i) */
        }
    }
\end{lstlisting}

In the above code, even when who cache line is loaded, we are not accessing the data in the order it is stored in the cache line. Hence we can interchange the loops to get the following code block:
\begin{lstlisting}
    for(int j = 0;j < 100; j++) {
        for(int i = 0;i < 100; i++) {
            /* Do Some work using f(j,i) */
        }
    }
\end{lstlisting}

This will enhance the spatial locality. Following is a example of Temporal Reuse: (Reuse in Time)
\begin{lstlisting}
    for(int i = 0;i < 100; i++) {
        for(int j = 0;j < 100; j++) {
            /* Do Some work using f(i) */
        }
    }
\end{lstlisting}

In General there are two types of reuse for both spatial and temporal locality - \textbf{Self Reuse}, \textbf{Group Reuse}

\subsection*{Group Temporal Reuse}
Consider the following code block:
\begin{lstlisting}
    load a[i][j];
    load a[i][j+1];
    load a[i][j+2];
\end{lstlisting}

These kind of access is called Group Temporal Reuse because $a[i][2], a[i][3], ..., a[i][N-3]$ are accessed 3 times. This is called Group Temporal Reuse. These kind of access can also be called as Group Spatial Reuse since we are accessing nearby (\textbf{contiguous}) memory locations.

\begin{lstlisting}
    load a[i][j];
\end{lstlisting}
This of access is called Self Temporal Reuse because $a[i][j]$ is again accessed if put in a loop not depending on i and j.

\subsection*{Matrix Multiplication}
Consider the following code block:
\begin{lstlisting}
for(i = 0;i < N; ++i) {
    for(j = 0;j < N; ++j) {
        for(k = 0;k < N; ++k) {
            C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
        }
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
Assuming all matrices $\in \mathcal{R}^{n \times n}$. Consider Cache Line Size of 64 Bytes, which means it can fit 16 elements of size 4 bytes. Further consider that $N^2 >> C_s$ (Cache Size).

Suppose if there is no Cache, then there are $4N^3$ memory accesses. Now Given Cache, lets try to compute the number of memory accesses which in this case means number of cache misses. \\

When we Load $A[1][1]$ is accessed then $A[1][1], A[1][2], A[1][3], \ldots, A[1][15]$ are loaded in the cache. For next 15 iterations we will have cache hits. But when we access $A[1][16]$ then $A[1][16], A[1][17], \ldots, A[1][31]$ are loaded in the cache and continue. \\

Overall we will have $\frac{N^3}{L}$ cache misses for A because of spatial locality. But B does not have spatial locality. Hence we will have $N^3$ cache misses for B. For $N$ iterations of $k$ loop, $C[i][j]$ is accesses so we assume this is in cache. Hence we will have $N^2$ loads and $N^2$ stores for C.

Hence overall memory accesses = $\frac{N^3}{L} + N^3 + 2N^2 \sim \mathcal{O}(N^3)$. Look about how accesses to B can conflict with accesses to A and why we only use 4 way set associative cache. \\

Suppose now we change the loop order from $(i,j,k) \rightarrow (k,j,i)$, then we will have the following code block:
\begin{lstlisting}
for(k = 0;k < N; ++k) {
    for(j = 0;j < N; ++j) {
        for(i = 0;i < N; ++i) {
            C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
        }
    }
}

\end{lstlisting}
Then $N^3$ accesses for A, $N^2$ accesses for B and $2N^3$ accesses for C. Hence overall memory accesses = $3N^3 + N^2 \sim \mathcal{O}(N^3)$. This order is worse than the previous order. \\

Now Lets consider table with all 6 possible orderings of loops. We will have the following table:
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Loop Order & A & B & C \\
        \hline
        $(i,j,k)$ & $N^3/L$ & $N^3$ & $2N^2$ \\
        $(k,j,i)$ & $N^3$ & $N^2$ & $2N^3$ \\
        $(i,k,j)$ & $N^2$ & $N^3/L$ & $2N^3/L$ \\
        $(j,i,k)$ & $N^3/L$ & $N^3$ & $2N^2$ \\
        $(j,k,i)$ & $N^3$ & $2N^2$ & $2N^3$ \\
        $(k,i,j)$ & $2N^2$ & $N^3/16$ & $2N^3/16$ \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

This is a example of fully permutable loops. In this case we can interchange the loops in any order and we will get the same results but performance will be different. From above table we can find that $(i,k,j)$ and $(k,i,j)$ are best orderings and they differ in $N^2$ memory accesses. \\
